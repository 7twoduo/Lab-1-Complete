# Terraform Lab – Usage Guide

> ⚠️ **Important:** This lab is designed to be reused in **your own AWS account**. Before running `terraform apply`, you **must customize several values** so resources are created correctly and safely.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before using this lab, make sure you have:

* An AWS account
* AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
* Terraform installed (v1.x recommended)
* A **registered domain name** (if using Route 53 / ACM / CloudFront)

---

## 1️⃣ Update the SNS Email Subscription

If this lab creates an **SNS topic with an email subscription**, you must replace the email address with your own.

### What to change

Locate the SNS subscription and update the email endpoint:


endpoint = "your-email@example.com"


### After Apply

AWS will send a **confirmation email**. The subscription will not activate until you confirm it.


## 2️⃣ Update Domain-Related Variables

Any variables related to:

* Domain names
* Hosted zones
* Subdomains
* ACM certificates



## 3️⃣ Change All S3 Bucket Names (REQUIRED)

S3 bucket names are **globally unique across AWS**.

### What to do

Update every S3 bucket name to something unique.

Recommended pattern:

If you do not change bucket names, Terraform will fail with:


BucketAlreadyExists


## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Manual EC2 Attachment for the Private Subnet ASG

#Go to the ec2 instance that is in the ASG for the private subnet, attach the appropriate EC2 IAM Role EC2_RDS. Reboot the Instance so the Userdata script restarts and runs properly.
Create a registered domain and import it into terraform in section 1c line 113


## 4️⃣ Customize Variables

This lab is intentionally configurable. You are encouraged to change:

* Instance sizes
* Auto Scaling Group min / max / desired capacity
* CIDR blocks
* Logging destinations (S3 vs CloudWatch)
* Feature flags (WAF, logging, alarms, etc.)

Review `variables.tf` carefully before applying.



## 5️⃣ Importing Existing AWS Resources

In some cases, AWS resources may already exist or Terraform may not automatically receive a resource identifier.

You may see errors such as:

```
Resource already exists
No resource identifier returned
```

In these cases, you must **import the resource into Terraform state**.

**ACM Certificate**
Example
terraform import aws_acm_certificate.cert arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/xxxx



## 7️⃣ Recommended Workflow

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

For updates:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 🧠 Learning Notes

* This lab reflects **real-world AWS + Terraform patterns**
* Resources are intentionally modular and conditional
* Breaking and rebuilding (safely) is part of the learning process

## 🎉 Enjoy the Code

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend this lab.

If something breaks, use it as an opportunity to learn how AWS and Terraform really behave.

Happy building 🚀

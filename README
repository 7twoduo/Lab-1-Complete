Here is how to use it.
# Terraform Lab – Usage Guide

> ⚠️ **Important:** This lab is designed to be reused in **your own AWS account**. Before running `terraform apply`, you **must customize several values** so resources are created correctly and safely.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites

Before using this lab, make sure you have:

* An AWS account
* AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
* Terraform installed (v1.x recommended)
* A **registered domain name** (if using Route 53 / ACM / CloudFront)

---

## 1️⃣ Update the SNS Email Subscription

If this lab creates an **SNS topic with an email subscription**, you must replace the email address with your own.

### What to change

Locate the SNS subscription and update the email endpoint:


endpoint = "your-email@example.com"


### After Apply

AWS will send a **confirmation email**. The subscription will not activate until you confirm it.


## 2️⃣ Update Domain-Related Variables

Any variables related to:

* Domain names
* Hosted zones
* Subdomains
* ACM certificates

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Manual EC2 Attachment for the Private Subnet ASG

#Go to the ec2 instance that is in the ASG for the private subnet, attach the appropriate EC2 IAM Role EC2_RDS. Reboot the Instance so the Userdata script restarts and runs properly.
Create a registered domain and import it into terraform in section 1c line 113
Change this the variable called root_domain_name to your root domain example "unshieldedhollow.click" and change the variable route53_domain_name to "www.unshieldedhollow.click"
Remember to change the region fo the userdata script if you are deploying in another region. Always change the secrets manager path when ever you reploy in the same region after destroying 

## 4️⃣ Customize Variables

This lab is intentionally configurable. You are encouraged to change:

* Instance sizes
* Auto Scaling Group min / max / desired capacity
* CIDR blocks
* Logging destinations (S3 vs CloudWatch)
* Feature flags (WAF, logging, alarms, etc.)

Review `variables.tf` carefully before applying.

Destroying

Make sure to clear out the s3 bucket or use ai like claude that will do it for you automatically and you should be good to go

Beware
S3 bucket can take 40 minutes some time in creation or more. It is an AWS side problem. I ran into that problem when deploying to a different region.
Reme
## 🎉 Enjoy the Code

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend this lab.

If something breaks, use it as an opportunity to learn how AWS and Terraform really behave.

Happy building 🚀
